## Introduction

This application has been built for our client, Transport for Wales, as part of our large-team project module. It represents the work we have carried out over the last 8 weeks as a group.

The objective of this application is to provide a cross-platform mobile application that seamlessly allows users to book transport for a desired journey; introducing means of public transport for residents situated in rural areas; namely, passengers that do not have spontaneous access to commercial, fixed-schedule transport. Through the IRT app, Transport for Wales in conjunction with the Welsh Government seeks to improve transport connectivity, employability and directly influence economical growth.

## Build Status

As of 05/04/2019 - Development has been halted as our project is coming to an end. The ideas and concepts illustrated and developed with the application have been conveyed and delivered to the client with utmost satisfaction. Transport for Wales now seeks to receive funding from the Welsh Government by using the demo we have developed as a 'taster'. Large scale development is now subject to approval by the Welsh Government.

## Examples

## Requirements

 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal
```bash
node -v
```

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal
```bash
npm -v
```
[Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation/)

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
To confirm that you have expo installed you can run this command in your terminal
```bash
expo -v
```

**Running  an Expo App on your device**

[Download for Android from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) or [for iOS from the App Store](https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?path=apps%2fexponent)

>**Required Android and iOS versions**: The minimum Android version Expo supports is Android 5 and the minimum iOS version is iOS 10.0.

**Emulator/Simulator - Android**

Follow the Expo [Adnroid Studio emulator guide](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to set up Android tools and create a virtual device. Start up the virtual device when it's ready.

You don't need to manually install the Expo client on your emulator/simulator, because Expo CLI will do that automatically (more on this later, but once the application launches it should automatically install Expo if you don't have it on the emulator)

**Emulator/Simulator - iOS**

Install [Xcode through the Apple app store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835). Next, open up Xcode, go to preferences and click the Components tab, install a simulator from the list.

Once the simulator is open and you have a project open in Expo Dev Tools, you can press Run on iOS simulator in Expo Dev Tools and it will install the Expo Client to the simulator and open up your app inside of it (more on this later)
